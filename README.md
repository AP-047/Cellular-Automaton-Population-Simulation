# Cellular Automaton Population Simulation

## Introduction
This simulation models the evolution of a population based on cellular automata, visualized through Unity. Adhering to Moore's Neighborhood rules, this project dynamically demonstrates the transitions between generations of cells.

## Methodology
- **State Analysis**: Developed algorithms in C# to determine the state of each cell based on its neighbors, using rules for birth, survival, and death.
- **Evolution Simulation**: Scripted the control flow to evolve the population through specified generations.
- **Visualization**: Utilized Unity to render the grid and display state changes with color-coded cells.

## Results
- Created a series of snapshots capturing the population state at various generation intervals, illustrating the emergent patterns and behaviors.
- The simulation verified theoretical expectations of cellular automaton behavior and showcased the impact of initial configurations on evolution.

## Technologies
- **C#**: For algorithm development and state management.
- **Unity**: For rendering the simulation and enabling interactive exploration.

## Usage
- The repository includes comprehensive scripts and a Unity project setup.
